# supercell-api
Service to provide capability to overcome the static IP limitation of the supercell games API.

> **PROOF OF CONCEPT**: https://statscell.herokuapp.com

## ABOUT
This is a service which is developed with the intention to remove the static IP limitation over the supercell games official API (`clash of clans`).
Currently the above mentioned game API requires to have a static IP while generating a key. But many people do not happen to have that, thus this service is developed to overcome the requirement of static IP.

> NOTE: This service is working for the above mentioned games, and is tested properly as well. You can have a look at the proof of concept linked at the top of the page.

## ENABLING THE OFFICIAL API
By default the API token fetching is disabled i.e. there is nothing working by default apart from the base route response. Keeping in mind that not everyone use every API, all the games API are disabled by default. You can selectively enable the ones you need by setting the respective game value true in `config.js`.

After setting the value to true, all the official API routes be available for you as well.

## HOW IT WORKS ??
This service simply logins to the developer portal at run time and generate a new key for the current IP of your device or host. All the API requests are made using the generated token now. The Service also checks if there is any key for the current host and also deletes old keys to not exceede the limit of keys for your developer account.

## EXTRA INFORMATION
- Currently the API has all the API routes covered for `clash of clans`, `clash royale` and `brawl stars`
- One can easily customize (add, delete, modify) API routes and their responses simply by visiting the `routes` folder in the the respective game folder (i.e. _clash_, _royale_ or _brawl_)
- One can setup custom authorization, save the responses to DB or anything as per the needs

## HOSTING OVER HEROKU
Thinking about a free platform to use this service, one can already think of **Heroku**, thus there is a `heroku` branch with things managed for the heroku Branch.
Also [This article](https://santoshb.com.np/blog/how-to-use-supercell-api-with-dynamic-ip/) contains a simple walkthrough to help you host this service over heroku securely.
